# responsive-portfolio
This readme is about the responsive portfolio that was created to give information myself.
An index.html was created to make the about me page, the page has a nav bar with links. the links are use to travel to the other pages such as the contact page and the portfolio page. The about me page has a description of myself and a picture featuring an animated character.
Another html file was created for the contact page. I used boostrage to fill in aside with a form. the contact page also has a nav bar with links to the other two pages. All three pages use the same backgroung with was taken from slack.
